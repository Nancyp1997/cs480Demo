- REST API with Nodejs and express at expressAppCode.   
- Stocks data from Yahoo finance API & Alpha vantage API.   
- Charts.js for data visualisation. 

To run this, 
- Execute MySQL scripts in DatabaseScripts.
- Copy the express app's index.js contents to index.js in a new replit app. REST API is setup.
- Get API key from Alpha vantage and execute the python notebooks in DataCollection. This populates the MySQL database with the API's responses.
- In chartjs-init.js replace the API calls with your own express app routes. 
- Open index.html to see the dashboard.
